Practicing the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

25th August 2025 - It is now a few weeks later and I have added some style to the pages. Still making mistakes and forgetting stuff but I will repair it all soon.
